There's a common instinct among engineers to wait until something is polished before sharing it. I used to feel the same way. But over the past year, I've shifted toward building in public — sharing work-in-progress, writing about what I'm learning, and being open about mistakes.

## The case for transparency

When you build in public, you create accountability. You're not just coding for yourself — you're explaining your decisions to an audience, even if that audience is small. This forces clarity of thought.

It also builds trust. Recruiters and founders don't just want to see finished products. They want to understand how you think, how you handle ambiguity, and whether you can communicate technical ideas clearly.

## What it looks like in practice

For me, building in public means:

- Writing blog posts about technical problems I've solved (or failed to solve)
- Keeping a notes section with short-form learnings
- Sharing project retrospectives that include what went wrong, not just what went right
- Committing to open-source repos even when the code isn't perfect

## The uncomfortable part

Not everything I share is good. Some of my early projects have messy code. Some of my notes contain half-formed ideas. That's the point. Growth is visible, and that's more valuable than a curated highlight reel.

## Start small

If you're thinking about building in public, start with one thing: write a short note about something you learned today. Don't overthink it. The habit matters more than the quality of any single post.
